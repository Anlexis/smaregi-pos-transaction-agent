"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 - caller-context bridge across the graph boundary."""

# Why this exists: GraphNode.execute() invokes the inner graph as
# `subgraph.invoke(user_input, session_id=..., ctx=...)` and does NOT forward
# the outer state's input_context, so an inner-node read of
# state["input_context"] would always see {} through the nested graph. The
# sanctioned subclass hooks bridge it:
#
#   SmaregiWorkflowGraphNode.extract_input(state)  [runs BEFORE subgraph.invoke]
#       -> set_caller_input_context(state["caller_fields"])
#   SmaregiWorkflowGraph._extra_initial_state()    [runs INSIDE subgraph.invoke]
#       -> returns {"input_context": get_caller_input_context()}
#
# What crosses the bridge is the VALIDATED caller contract produced by
# PreProcessNode - never the raw request body - so the inner graph is only ever
# handed fields that already passed their type, shape, range and length bounds.
#
# The alternative, smuggling caller data inside the validated_input JSON, is not
# usable here: the framework masks that field at every node boundary, so a
# caller-supplied store id of the wrong digit shape can be rewritten to
# [MASKED] between hops. This channel is not masked, which is also why
# PreProcessNode screens and bounds every field before they enter it.
#
# A ContextVar keeps the hand-off correct per thread/task, so concurrent
# invocations in one process cannot see each other's context.
