# tests/proof_of_boundary/test_pb7_hitl_interrupt_propagation.py
#
# PB-7 (CONDITIONAL): required only when config/agent.yaml sets
# hitl.enabled: true. CMN-C2-285 is a non-HITL template (no node calls
# interrupt(); config/agent.yaml declares no hitl block), so PB-7 is
# **Auto-waived - non-HITL** per docs/03_test_spec.md and both cases below
# SKIP via the module-level skipif.
#
# Canonical skip-stub form: the bodies are REAL AssertionErrors (never
# `assert True`), so if hitl.enabled is ever flipped on without implementing
# the PB-7 cases, the suite fails loudly instead of silently passing.
#
# The HITL contract this stub stands in for: a node that calls interrupt()
# needs a checkpointer attached (hitl.enabled / memory_enabled) and must
# respect the parent's hitl_allowed guard.
